# Restaurant Sales Order Analysis Using - SQL
# About
This project analyzes restaurant sales data to gain insights into menu performance, order trends, and customer preferences. By leveraging SQL queries, we explore revenue patterns, the popularity of dishes, and sales distribution across different food categories. The goal is to develop data-driven recommendations to improve menu offerings and optimize pricing strategies.
# Goal:
To conduct a comprehensive analysis of restaurant sales data and derive meaningful insights about customer behavior, best-selling items, and revenue generation.
# Dataset Source
The dataset was obtained from Maven Analytics, a leading platform that provides real-world business datasets for data analysis and visualization.
## Overview
The dataset contains transactional data from a restaurant, including details on menu items and customer orders. It consists of two main tables:

menu_items – Contains details of food items, including item name, category, and price.
order_details – Records customer orders, including order ID, order date, order time, and the items purchased.
Each table is linked using the menu_item_id field, allowing us to analyze how different food items contribute to overall sales.
